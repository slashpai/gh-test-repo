      **Note:** This repository is about prometheus-operator itself, if you have questions about:
            - kube-prometheus setup, go to [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus)
            - helm installation, go to [kube-prometheus-stack-helm-chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts)
